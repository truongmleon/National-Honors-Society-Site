      <p class="emphasis">"Since 1925, Key Club International has provided more than 12 million hours of service to homes, schools, and communities each year. From building bridges, to collecting over six tons of food, thousands of dollars raised for cancer research, helping eliminate iodine deficiency disorder, Key Club International plays a vital role in serving the children of the world.</p>
      <p class="emphasis">In 1946, the organization was challenged to build a program to bring together all Key Clubs and members to focus energies on making an international impact. This program is still followed today through the Major Emphasis:¬†Children: Their Future, Our Focus.</p>
      <p class="emphasis">To fulfill the Major Emphasis, Key Club International serves children in many ways. By working with Key Club International's partner organizations, Key Clubs serve children by aiding other organizations committed to serving children. Key Club International celebrates its three partnerships: UNICEF, March of Dimes, and Children's Miracle Network.</p>
      <p class="emphasis">The Key Club service initiative is another element of the Major Emphasis and is created on a two-year basis. All of the hands-on service provided to children by Key Club International members is directed to a single area of need, to make a substantial impact." - Key Club International</p>
