      <p data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="info-paragraph"> WE serve the community by demonstrating scholarship, leadership, service, and character.</p>
    <p data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="info-paragraph">NHS is a <u>student-led</u> organization that commits to providing service opportunities with a goal to grow leaders and an engaging community.</p>
    <p data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="info-paragraph"><i>Service? Why should I make the <u>effort</u> to join NHS if I can do service in my own time?</i></p>
    <p data-aos="zoom-in-up" class="info-paragraph">Having time commitment to investing in acts of service will net <b>character development and develop leadership skills</b>. 
      NHS adds the extra benefit of being in a high school <u>community</u> with like-minded individuals. As a club that only meets once a month, you can attend other clubs afterschool and focus on service outside of it (I'm in Chess Club!).
      While most of your hours are earned outside of school, our NHS meetings offer a way to earn some service hours with fun events (also, snacks at every meeting!).</p>

      <p class="emphasis">"Unveiled over a century ago, the National Honor Society enshrines four pillars at its heart: Scholarship, Service, Leadership, and Character. More than mere badges of honor for NHS members, these principles are transformative keys that unlock potential, enhancing every student‚Äôs educational journey, and ultimately empowering them to make profound, enduring contributions to our world.</p>
      <p class="emphasis">Scholarship is more than a report card; it represents a dedicated commitment to lifelong learning. It‚Äôs about optimizing the educational opportunities offered and pursuing knowledge within and beyond academic confines. Scholarship necessitates a consistent effort, with an aspiration to contribute positively to the world through one‚Äôs own knowledge, skills, and experiences.</p>
      <p class="emphasis">Service represents the choice of stepping outside oneself to meet the needs of others, fueled by an unwavering passion for a cause, heartfelt empathy for others, or driven by personal circumstances. It‚Äôs about performing selfless acts that transcend the ordinary, engendering transformative changes that resonate through our schools, ripple across our communities, and reverberate on a global scale. In the noble act of service, we sculpt a better world with our hands, our hearts, and our humanity.</p>
      <p class="emphasis">Leadership is more than a position or title; it means embodying the spirit of initiative, innovation, and influence. It‚Äôs about inspiring peers through actions, nurturing a collaborative environment, and championing positive change. Student leaders embrace the responsibility of shaping their academic community, all while fostering personal growth and development. It‚Äôs an interplay of intellect, empathy, and resilience, guiding others while continually learning and evolving.</p>
      <p class="emphasis">Character is the essence of who we are. It is about valuing diversity, building relationships grounded in empathy, and exhibiting qualities like perseverance, respect, integrity, and honesty. Character lies not in public acts of virtue or visible mistakes, but in the consistent commitment to ethical and compassionate decision-making that positively affects both oneself and others." - National Honors Society</p>
